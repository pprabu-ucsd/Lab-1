I am an **avid programmer**, working with _ _several languages_ _ like ***Python, C, C++, Java, and more***. I love to read, but when programming, I have a tendency to kind of wing my assignments, leading to a lot of hassle at times. However, those experiences help me learn to be better with my time.

My favorite language is

> C++

I feel like what defines me as a person is:
```My perseverance and willingness to problem-solve.```
